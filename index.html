          <p>
            Look at the top two cards, they're blue. These two cards make up
            your main character. This character is who your story is about.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Step 3: Plot Cards</h3>
          <p>
            Now it's time to look at the next two cards, the green ones. These
            are your plot cards. Remember, every great story is about a
            character who wants something and has to overcome an obstacle to get
            it. One these cards should be your character want and the other one
            should be the obstacle. However, it's your story so you can take the
            plot anywhere you'd like.
          </p>

            write your story. So open your favorite writting app and start
            writing.
